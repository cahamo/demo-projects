# Rotary encoder demo

This collection of three projects demonstrate how to use &quot;Neopixel&quot; rings and matrices.

The projects can be found in the following sub directories:

* `neopixel-matrix-1--uno` - Runs a snake of different coloured pixels from top left to bottom right of an 8&times;8 pixel matrix. Based on example code from the `Adafruit_NeoMatrix` library.

* `neopixel-matrix-2--uno` - Scrolls text across an 8&times;8 pixel matrix. Based on example code from the `Adafruit_NeoMatrix` library.

* `neopixel-ring--uno` - Animates solid and random colours around a 12 pixel ring. Modified from code by [Elon on Medium](https://tinyurl.com/3bc2fbb6).

All three projects were developed using PlatformIO within VSCode and is targeted at an Arduino Uno.

The code accompanies the <a href="https://cahamo.delphidabbler.com/demos/neopixels">&quot;Neopixels&quot; Demos</a> page on the cahamo website.
