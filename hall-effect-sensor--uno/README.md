# Hall effect sensor demo

This project demonstrates how to use both a &quot;bare&quot; Hall effect sensor and a Hall effect sensor module.

The source code presented here accompanies the [Hall Effect Sensor Demo](https://cahamo.delphidabbler.com/demos/hall-effect-sensor) page on the cahamo website.

The code was developed using PlatformIO within VSCode and is targeted at an Arduino Uno.
