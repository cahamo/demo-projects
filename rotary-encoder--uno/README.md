# Rotary encoder demo

This project demonstrates how to use a 5V EC11 rotary encoder, which incorporates a push-to-make switch.

The source code presented here accompanies the [Rotary Encoder Demo](https://cahamo.delphidabbler.com/demos/rotary-encoder) page on the cahamo website.

The code was developed using PlatformIO within VSCode and is targeted at an Arduino Uno.
