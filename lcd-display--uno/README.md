# LCD display demo

This project demonstrates how to use a LCD displays that are compatible with the Hitachi HD44780 driver using a 16 pin interface.

The source code presented here accompanies the [LCD Display Demo](https://cahamo.delphidabbler.com/demos/lcd-display) page on the cahamo website.

The code was developed using PlatformIO within VSCode and is targeted at an Arduino Uno.

> As written, the source code works with a 20 column, 4 row display. It can be adapted for other display sizes simply by changing the values of the `COLUMNS` and `ROW` macros.
